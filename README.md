## What is Cryptocurrency Exchange Arbitrage?

Cryptocurrency exchange arbitrage is a trading strategy that capitalizes on price discrepancies of digital assets across different exchanges. This tool automates the process of buying cryptocurrencies on one exchange at a lower price and selling them on another at a higher price, potentially generating profits from these market inefficiencies.

## Mahdi's Exchange Arbitrage Executions (Punches)

Our unique arbitrage strategies are inspired by boxing techniques, offering a blend of speed and precision in crypto trading:

1. **Cross Punch**: A direct arbitrage between two exchanges
2. **Hook Punch**: A complex strategy utilizing intermediate cryptocurrencies
3. **Kung Fu Punch**: A strategic pause in trading activities

For an in-depth look at these strategies, including diagrams and example scenarios, see our [Trading Strategies Guide](docs/trading_strategies.pdf).
