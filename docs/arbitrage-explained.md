# Arbitrage Explained

Cryptocurrency arbitrage is a trading strategy that aims to profit from the price differences of the same asset on different exchanges. This document explains the concept in detail and how our tool implements it.

## What is Arbitrage?

Arbitrage in the cryptocurrency market occurs when there's a price discrepancy for the same cryptocurrency on different exchanges. Traders can profit from this discrepancy by buying the asset on the exchange where it's cheaper and selling it on the exchange where it's more expensive.

## How Our Tool Implements Arbitrage

1. **Market Monitoring**: Our tool continuously monitors the prices of cryptocurrencies on Coinbase and Binance.

2. **Opportunity Detection**: When a price discrepancy is detected that exceeds a certain threshold, the tool identifies it as a potential arbitrage opportunity.

3. **Risk Assessment**: The tool calculates potential profit, taking into account transaction fees, withdrawal fees, and potential slippage.

4. **Execution**: If the opportunity is deemed profitable, the tool executes the trade automatically using our "Punches" strategies.

5. **Reconciliation**: After execution, the tool updates balances and prepares for the next opportunity.

## Risks and Considerations

- Market volatility can eliminate arbitrage opportunities quickly.
- Transaction times between exchanges can affect profitability.
- Exchange fees and withdrawal limits need to be carefully considered.
