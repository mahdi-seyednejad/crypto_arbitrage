# Features Documentation

This document provides a detailed explanation of the key features of our Cryptocurrency Exchange Arbitrage tool.

## 1. Real-time Arbitrage Detection

Our tool continuously monitors price feeds from Coinbase and Binance, identifying potential arbitrage opportunities in real-time. It uses efficient data structures and algorithms to process large volumes of market data quickly.

## 2. Custom "Mahdiable" Algorithm

The heart of our arbitrage detection is the proprietary "Mahdiable" algorithm. This algorithm analyzes the limit order books of both exchanges to identify profitable trading opportunities, taking into account:

- Price discrepancies
- Order book depth
- Transaction fees
- Potential slippage

## 3. Asynchronous Processing

To ensure high-speed execution, our tool leverages asynchronous programming techniques. This allows for concurrent monitoring of multiple cryptocurrency pairs and simultaneous execution of trades when opportunities arise.

## 4. Multi-API Support

The tool can use multiple API keys for the same exchange, allowing for load balancing and higher transaction limits. This feature is particularly useful during times of high market volatility when quick execution is crucial.

## 5. TimescaleDB Integration

We use TimescaleDB, a time-series database built on PostgreSQL, for efficient storage and analysis of historical market data. This integration allows for:

- Fast insertion of high-frequency market data
- Efficient querying for historical analysis
- Scalability to handle growing datasets

## 6. Risk Management

Our tool incorporates various risk management features, including:

- Stop-loss mechanisms
- Position size limits
- Volatility checks
